<h4>Link :<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/44074/Shiguang_Dailiren?q=link%20click&cat=anime">mal</a></h4>
<p>This is basically a story about 2 friends cheng xioshi and Lu guang running a photography shop.There is a twist .They have the ability to dive into the photograhs.Cheng can dive into the photograph and lu can see through the future in the photograph and guide Cheng.
<p>The thing I like about this anime is the unique approach of time travel ,the characters and the unpredictibility of the story as cheng and lu guang go through different scenarios in the photos and the effect of changing the past and the impeding tragedy with a nice suspenseful atmosphere.</p>

<p>This story is about yashiro a young girl and all she wanted was a romantic relationship and she has a crush on a popular boy who is her senior minamoto.In this school kanome academy there are 7 wonders and the 7th one is the story about a ghost hanako san a girl with a bob cut and a red skirt who resides in the girls bathroom and will grant u a wish for a price that is if u summon them right.So hearing this yashiro tried summoning hanakoonly to discover he was a boy.After few incidents they were bound by a curse due to yashiro's foolishness.The price she paid was labor being hankos assisstant.</p>
<p>What I like about this story  is that the way it balances the comedy aspect and the dark aspects of the story.Also Im in love with the art style .It has epic plot twists which will keep u hooked with few emotional storylines.Then there is hanako and we still dont know his backstory except for the fact spoilers: (his name is yugi amane born at the time when humans went to moon for the first time probably and killed his older brother tsukasa with a kitchen knife).Really looking forward for season 2</p>

<li><h3>Natsume and the book of friends :</h3>
<h4>GENRE: slice of life,Drama,Supernatural</h4>

<h4>Link :<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou">mal</a></h4>
<p>The story is about a boy called natsume Takashi who can see things people cant "yokai" .These are spirits with their own stories.The book of friends is the only thing left behind by his grandmother .The story starts with natsume accidentally breaking the seal of a dangerous yokai.</p>
<p>My favourite thing about this is the fact that it has no romance and no unncessary fanservice.The next thing is the life lessons it teaches us which is portrayed beautifully in a poetic matter.Natsume himself is another element that this anime is a must watch.He is relatable ,you just want to see him happy and support his growth.The stor of his loneliness and slowly forming connections was very interesting.Also each yokai have their own stories to tell.Also its a plus if u love cats.</p>
